Compression does the heavy lifting: timestamps at a fixed scrape interval compress to almost nothing with delta-of-delta encoding, and consecutive float values in a well-behaved metric share most of their bits, so XOR-then-encode gets you from 16 bytes to about 1.3. That 12x is the difference between roughly 9 TB a day and 750 GB a day, and it is the single most consequential encoding decision in the system.

So a 4x-per-point multiplier partially cancels the 4x reduction in point count from 15 s to 60 s. The real saving comes from the hour tier, which is 60x fewer points.

Second, <strong>shard rules across evaluators by rule hash</strong> and stagger their evaluation offsets, so ten thousand rules do not all fire their queries on the same second. Third, <strong>keep the alert instance state machine separate from evaluation</strong>: an expression being true is not an alert, it becomes one only after it has been true for the rule's <code class='tok'>for</code> duration, and the pending-to-firing transition is what suppresses flapping.

Limit on tokens, ideally with a token bucket over input-plus-output tokens per time window, and enforce a per-request output cap so a single call cannot monopolise a slot. Safety needs two passes: a cheap pre-check on the input before you spend an accelerator on it, and a streaming post-filter on the output. The post-filter is the awkward one — you are emitting tokens as they are produced, so a filter must either buffer a small window (adding latency) or be able to retract, which most transports cannot do. The honest resolution is a short buffered window of a sentence or so, plus a hard stop that terminates the stream with a clear reason. Say that out loud rather than pretending post-filtering is free." },
