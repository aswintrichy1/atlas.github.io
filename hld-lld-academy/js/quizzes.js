        "answer": 1,
        "explain": "A same-DC round trip is ~0.5 ms and reading 1 MB sequentially from SSD is ~1 ms. Knowing these 'latency numbers every engineer should know' lets you sanity-check designs instantly."

        "explain": "A day has ~86,400 seconds. 86,000,000 / 86,400 ≈ 1,000 QPS. The handy trick: 86,400 ≈ 10⁵, so requests-per-day ÷ 10⁵ ≈ average QPS. Remember to also plan for peak (often 2–5× average)."

        "answer": 1,

        "answer": 1,

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explain": "With cache-aside, the application checks the cache, and on a miss it reads the DB and then populates the cache. The cache stays 'dumb'. (Read-through delegates that loading to the cache layer instead.)"

        "answer": 1,
        "explain": "LRU = Least Recently Used. It evicts the item whose last access is oldest. LFU evicts the least frequently used; FIFO evicts the oldest inserted regardless of access."

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explain": "Write-back acknowledges the write after updating only the cache, flushing to the DB asynchronously. That's fast, but if the cache node dies before the flush, those writes are lost unless you add durability (e.g., replication / WAL)."

        "answer": 1,
        "explain": "If many keys expire at the same instant, all the misses hit the DB at once (a stampede). Adding random jitter to TTLs spreads expirations out. Stampedes are also mitigated by request coalescing / locks."

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explain": "Sharding (horizontal partitioning) splits rows across multiple machines so no single node holds all the data or absorbs all the writes. It adds complexity (cross-shard queries, rebalancing) in exchange for scale."

          "Reads must always go to the leader"
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explain": "Async replication lets the leader ack writes without waiting for followers, so followers can lag. Reading from a follower can therefore return stale data — a read-your-writes consistency concern."

          "A composite hashed key"
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explain": "A monotonically increasing key (like a timestamp or auto-increment id) routes all new writes to the same shard, creating a hotspot. Hashing or high-cardinality keys spread writes evenly."

          "Queueing background jobs"
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explain": "Column stores keep values from the same column together, so analytic scans and aggregations read only the needed columns and compress well. OLTP row stores are better for fetching or updating complete entities."

        "options": [
          "They never persist data",

          "They require every query to be a full scan",
          "They avoid replication entirely"
        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explain": "LSM trees write to an in-memory structure and append sorted files, then compact in the background. That favors high write rates, but compaction introduces read, write, and space amplification."

        "answer": 1,

        ],
        "answer": 2,

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explain": "Under eventual consistency, replicas may temporarily disagree, but absent new writes they converge. It trades immediate correctness for availability and low latency."

        ],
        "answer": 1,
        "explain": "A queue decouples producers from consumers and absorbs bursts (load leveling). Consumers process at their own pace. Exactly-once is notoriously hard — most systems give at-least-once + idempotency."

        "answer": 1,
