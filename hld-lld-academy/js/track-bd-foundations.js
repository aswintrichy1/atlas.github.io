        {
          q: "Your shortener creates five million links a day and generates seven-character base62 codes at random with a conditional insert. Why does seven characters work comfortably where six would not?",
          options: [
            "Six characters cannot encode both letters and digits, only digits.",
            "Seven characters is the longest path segment a redirect response can carry.",
            "Six-character codes cannot be used as a partition key in a key-value store.",
            "Six characters gives about 5.7e10 codes, so a decade of creates fills roughly a third of the space and collision retries climb steeply; seven gives about 3.5e12, where the same volume stays under one percent."
          ],
          answer: 3,
          explain: "Random generation is only cheap while the keyspace is sparse. Retry probability tracks occupancy, so a third-full space means a meaningful fraction of inserts collide and the write path gets a second round trip. Sizing the keyspace against ten years of creates is the calculation that justifies the code length."
        },
        {
          q: "In a chunked file-sync upload, why does the service commit the file manifest to the metadata store only after every chunk is durably in the object store?",
          options: [
            "Chunks are content-addressed, so a chunk nobody points at is harmless garbage the collector reclaims later, while a manifest pointing at a missing chunk is a corrupt file.",
            "The object store cannot accept writes while a metadata transaction is open.",
            "The metadata store is slower, so writing it last shortens the request.",
            "Deduplication only works when the manifest is written last."
          ],
          answer: 0,
          explain: "The two stores fail independently, so you choose which direction the inconsistency points. An orphan chunk costs disk until garbage collection runs; a manifest referencing bytes that never landed is a file the user cannot open. Order the writes so the cheap failure is the one you can have."
        },
        {
          q: "Two reviews for the same restaurant land in the same millisecond. Each request reads avg_rating and review_count, computes the new average, and writes both back. What actually happens, and what is the fix?",
          options: [
            "Nothing goes wrong; the database serializes the two updates for you.",
            "One update is lost because both transactions read the same starting values. Store rating_sum and rating_count and increment them atomically, deriving the average on read.",

            "The review row is inserted twice; add an idempotency key to the insert."
          ],
          answer: 1,
          explain: "This is a plain lost update: read-modify-write without a version check or a lock. Replacing the derived value with two atomic increments removes the read entirely, so concurrent writers commute and the average is computed from state that is always correct. Deriving on read costs nothing at this write rate."
        },

          q: "Why is broadcasting a new delivery order to every courier within two kilometres and letting the first tap win a weak design?",

            "It breaks the ordering guarantee of the message queue that carries offers.",
            "It turns every order into a contended race that most couriers lose, burns their attention on offers they will not get, and hands you no control over which courier the order should actually go to.",
            "It makes the geospatial index too large to hold in memory."
          ],
          answer: 2,
          explain: "Broadcast optimises for one metric, time-to-acceptance, and wrecks everything else. You lose the ability to rank on distance, direction of travel and acceptance history, and couriers learn to ignore offers because most of them evaporate. A ranked offer with a short expiry keeps the same speed while preserving control."

            "One conditional update on the seat row that sets the hold only where the seat is free or its previous hold has already expired, with the affected row count deciding the winner."
          ],
          answer: 3,
          explain: "The invariant lives on one row, so the cheapest correct enforcement is a single-row compare-and-set inside the database that already owns that row. A distributed lock adds a second system that can fail independently, and a single serialising worker is a correctness-by-bottleneck answer. Expiry belongs inside the same predicate so a stale hold never blocks a sale."

            "Authors above a follower threshold are skipped on push; their recent posts are pulled and merged at read time, so one post no longer consumes tens of minutes of the entire fan-out budget.",

            "It stops precomputing feeds entirely and merges every author at read time.",
            "It compresses feed entries so the same post costs fewer bytes."
          ],
          answer: 0,
          explain: "The celebrity problem is not that the writes are slow, it is that they are unbounded per post and share a queue with everyone else. Excluding high-fan-out authors from push caps the write amplification, and merging their handful of recent posts at read time is cheap because there are few such authors per reader. You pay a small, bounded read cost to remove an unbounded write cost."

          q: "Your ranked feed has a 300 ms p99 budget and scoring one candidate costs about 20 microseconds of CPU. Why does the design retrieve roughly five hundred candidates rather than scoring everything eligible?",
          options: [
            "The ranking model is only accurate when given exactly five hundred items.",
            "Cost scales linearly with candidates: seven thousand feed builds a second at five hundred candidates is already about seventy cores of pure scoring, and an unbounded candidate set makes both CPU and the latency budget unbounded.",
            "HTTP clients cap responses at five hundred items.",
            "The candidate store cannot return more than five hundred rows in one query."
          ],
          answer: 1,
          explain: "Retrieval exists to make ranking affordable, not to improve it. Fixing the candidate count converts an open-ended cost into a line item you can multiply out and defend, and it puts a hard ceiling on the scoring stage of the latency budget. Quality then comes from better retrieval sources, not from scoring more things."

            "The client suppresses the duplicate notification when it arrives twice."
          ],
          answer: 2,
          explain: "Read-then-write on two separate rows can produce zero matches or two, depending on interleaving. Collapsing both directions onto one row keyed by the sorted pair turns mutuality into a single atomic transition that exactly one request can perform. Emitting the notification from that transition, through an outbox, keeps retries from duplicating it."

          q: "Contest peak on a coding judge implies roughly six thousand CPU-seconds of judging work per second. What is the right response?",

            "Queue it: accept the submission immediately, hand back a durable id and a visible position, and drain a bounded worker pool with per-user fairness so one contestant cannot starve the rest."
          ],
          answer: 3,
          explain: "Judging is a batch workload with a bursty arrival pattern and a tolerable wait, which is exactly the shape a queue is for. Provisioning for a peak that lasts ninety minutes a week wastes almost all of the capacity, and cutting test coverage trades correctness for cost. Fairness has to be explicit, or the heaviest submitter takes the whole pool."
        },

          q: "In a multi-device chat system, what does a 'delivered' tick most defensibly mean?",

            "The server accepted and persisted the message.",
            "The sender's client finished uploading the message."
          ],
          answer: 0,
          explain: "Delivery is a property of the recipient's devices, not of your server, so a tick that fires on server persistence is lying about a state the sender cares about. Once you accept multiple devices, 'delivered' needs a quantifier: any device or all devices. Pick one, write it down, and make the receipt derive from device cursors rather than a separate flag that can drift."
