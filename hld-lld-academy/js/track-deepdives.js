      questions: [
        {
          q: "Under Postgres MVCC, what does an UPDATE physically do to a row?",
          options: [
            "Overwrites the row in place and blocks readers until the transaction commits",
            "Appends only to the write-ahead log; the table is reconstructed at read time",
            "Writes a new row version and leaves the old one visible to older snapshots",
            "Marks the row dirty and defers the change until the next VACUUM"
          ],
          answer: 2,
          explain: "Postgres never overwrites a live row. An update inserts a new version and marks the old one dead for transactions whose snapshot started later, which is exactly why readers never block writers and writers never block readers. The cost is that dead versions accumulate until VACUUM reclaims them, so update-heavy tables bloat and their indexes grow."
        },
        {
          q: "A Cassandra keyspace has replication factor 3 (N = 3) and you write at QUORUM. What is the weakest read consistency level that still guarantees you see that acknowledged write?",

            "ONE — R + W = 3",
            "ANY — replication makes the read level irrelevant",
            "ALL — R + W = 5",
            "QUORUM — R + W = 4"
          ],
          answer: 3,
          explain: "The overlap rule is R + W > N. With N = 3 and W = QUORUM = 2, you need R > 1, so R = 2 = QUORUM is the weakest level that forces the read set and the write set to share at least one replica. ONE gives R + W = 3, which is not greater than 3, so a read can legally hit the one replica that missed the write."
        },
        {
          q: "Cassandra buffers writes in a memtable and flushes immutable SSTables to disk. What is the direct consequence for reads?",
          options: [
            "A read may have to consult several SSTables, so read amplification rises until compaction merges them",
            "Reads are faster than a B-tree because every SSTable is sorted",
            "Reads always touch exactly one SSTable, because the partition key selects it",
            "Reads never touch disk, because the memtable holds the whole partition"
          ],
          answer: 0,
          explain: "An LSM engine makes writes cheap by only ever appending — but a given partition's rows can then be spread across the memtable and many SSTables at once. A read has to merge all of those, which is why each SSTable carries its own Bloom filter and why compaction exists. Compaction is not housekeeping you can skip; it is what keeps read amplification bounded, and it costs disk and I/O to run."
        },

          q: "You model a sensor feed as PRIMARY KEY ((sensor_id), reading_time), with readings arriving every second and retained for years. What is the defect?",

            "Every read would require ALLOW FILTERING"
          ],
          answer: 1,
          explain: "A partition lives entirely on its replica set, so an unbounded partition means one set of nodes absorbs unbounded data and unbounded traffic for that sensor. Compaction, repair and reads all degrade as the partition grows. The fix is a compound partition key that adds a time bucket, such as ((sensor_id, day), reading_time), which caps each partition's size by construction."

          q: "Why does single-table design exist in DynamoDB?",
          options: [
            "It is cheaper, because DynamoDB bills a fixed fee per table",
            "DynamoDB enforces a hard limit of one table per account",

          ],
          answer: 2,
          explain: "DynamoDB gives you fast access to one item collection at a time and nothing that resembles a join. Single-table design overloads generic key attributes so that an order and its line items and its shipment share a partition key and differ only by sort key, which turns what would be three round trips into one Query. The price is that the keys stop being self-describing and you must know every access pattern before you design the keys."

          ],
          answer: 3,
          explain: "Because one command runs at a time, every command is effectively atomic and you never need a lock to do read-modify-write on a single key. The same property means the server has no way to work around a slow command: one scan over a million-member set makes every other client wait behind it. That is why the operational rule is to keep individual commands small and bounded."

            "The common fsync policy and asynchronous replication mean an acknowledged write can still be lost in a crash or a failover",

          ],
          answer: 0,
          explain: "Redis can persist, but the default posture trades durability for speed: the append-only file is typically synced about once a second, and replicas acknowledge nothing before the primary replies to the client. A crash or an automatic failover can therefore drop writes the client was already told succeeded. That is acceptable for a cache or a leaderboard and unacceptable for money."
        },

          q: "Why is Elasticsearch described as near-real-time, and what does that imply architecturally?",

            "Indexing is synchronous but query results are cached for a second",
            "A document becomes searchable only once the buffer is refreshed into a new segment — about a second by default — so treat it as a secondary index fed from a system of record",

            "Replication is synchronous and adds a fixed one-second delay to every write"
          ],
          answer: 1,
          explain: "Lucene segments are immutable, so a newly indexed document is invisible to search until a refresh rolls the in-memory buffer into a new segment. That refresh is cheap but not free, which is why it is periodic rather than per-document. Since you also give up cross-document transactions and joins, the safe pattern is to own the truth elsewhere and rebuild the index from it whenever the mapping changes."

          ],
          answer: 2,
          explain: "A Kafka partition is an append-only log with monotonically increasing offsets, and that is the only scope in which order exists. Records in different partitions have no defined relative order at all, no matter what the acks setting is. This is why key selection is a design decision: keying by account id preserves per-account order, while keying by request id destroys it."

          ],
          answer: 3,
          explain: "Within a consumer group, each partition has exactly one owner, so partition count is a hard ceiling on consumer parallelism. Adding consumers beyond that only adds idle processes and one more rebalance. If you need more parallelism you must raise the partition count, which is a decision to make early because increasing it later changes which partition an existing key hashes to."

          answer: 0,
          explain: "Committing after processing means the only failure window is 'work done, offset not recorded', which on restart replays records you already handled. That is at-least-once, and it is the right default. Committing before processing would flip the window and give you at-most-once, losing records instead of duplicating them; neither ordering of the two steps is atomic, which is why idempotent handlers are the real fix."

          answer: 1,
          explain: "Processing-time windows bucket by when the operator saw the record, so an hour-late upload would land in the wrong minute entirely. Event-time windows bucket by the timestamp carried in the record, and watermarks are the mechanism that decides when a window has waited long enough to emit. The trade-off is direct: more watermark slack catches more stragglers but delays every result by that much."

Exactly-once effects therefore need the sink to participate, either by committing transactionally with the checkpoint or by making repeated writes harmless."

          ],
          answer: 1,
          explain: "A geohash prefix names a rectangle, and two points either side of a rectangle's edge get different prefixes no matter how close they are. The standard fix is to query the containing cell plus its eight neighbours, which guarantees full coverage out to the cell size, then compute real distances on the candidate set and sort.

          answer: 2,
          explain: "A series is identified by its metric name plus the full set of label values, so every distinct combination is a separate indexed stream with its own in-memory head chunk. One well-meant label like user_id turns a handful of series into millions and the ingest node runs out of memory.

          answer: 3,
          explain: "The workload is append-at-the-head, so time partitioning keeps the write-hot region small enough to stay in memory while everything behind it stops changing. Immutable older chunks can then be aggressively compressed with delta and XOR encodings, replaced by rollups, and expired with a metadata operation instead of a mass delete. Dropping a partition is close to free; deleting a billion rows by predicate is not."

          answer: 0,
          explain: "Approximate indexes work by examining a small, cleverly chosen subset of the vectors, and the search parameter controls how large that subset is. Examining more of the space finds more of the true nearest neighbours and costs proportionally more time. There is no universally correct setting, so you pick a recall target, measure recall against an exact brute-force baseline on a sample, and tune until latency and recall are both acceptable."

          answer: 1,
          explain: "The approximate index is built over the whole collection, so its graph or cluster structure does not know about your predicate. Searching first and filtering after can leave you with almost nothing when the predicate is selective, while filtering first produces a small set that the index has no efficient path through, pushing you toward a brute-force scan. Engines mitigate this with filtered traversal, but recall degrades as selectivity rises, so measure it rather than assuming it works."

          ],
          answer: 2,
          explain: "Adding a key sets k specific bits, so if any of a query's k bits is zero the key was certainly never added — that answer is exact and there are no false negatives. If all k bits are set, they may have been set by a combination of other keys, which is a false positive. The whole design is that asymmetry: a 'no' is proof, a 'yes' is a hint that justifies the expensive lookup."

          ],
          answer: 3,
          explain: "The bug is the dual write: two independent systems cannot be updated atomically, so any crash between them leaves them disagreeing, and reversing the order just changes which way they disagree. The outbox pattern removes the second system from the critical path by making the event a row in the same transaction as the business data, so both commit or neither does. A separate relay then publishes at-least-once from that table, which is why consumers must still be idempotent."
