        answer: 1,
        explain: "Encryption keeps data unreadable to unauthorized parties — that is confidentiality. Integrity is protected by hashes/signatures, and availability by redundancy and backups."

        options: ["Threat + Vulnerability", "The CVSS score on its own", "Likelihood \u00d7 Impact", "The total number of vulnerabilities"],
        answer: 2,
        explain: "Risk = Likelihood \u00d7 Impact. A severe-looking vulnerability with no plausible threat or low impact can be a lower risk than a trivially exploitable flaw on a critical asset."

        answer: 3,
        explain: "Fail-safe defaults mean security decisions deny on uncertainty. Many breaches come from checks that failed open under error or load and simply let requests through."

        options: ["key", "algorithm", "source code", "network diagram"],
        answer: 0,
        explain: "Strength must live in the key, not in secrecy of the design. This is why 'security by obscurity' is not a real control and why we use open, vetted algorithms."

        options: ["Authentication", "Authorization", "Integrity", "Availability"],
        answer: 1,
        explain: "Elevation of privilege means gaining rights you should not have, which is an authorization failure. Spoofing maps to authentication; tampering to integrity; DoS to availability."

        options: ["a firewall rule", "an encryption key", "a point where data passes between zones of different trust", "a user role"],
        answer: 2,

        answer: 3,
        explain: "Least privilege does not stop the first foothold — it limits how far that foothold can reach, turning 'game over' into a contained incident."

        answer: 0,
        explain: "OAuth 2.0 delegates authorization ('let this app read my calendar'). For authentication you add OIDC on top — using raw OAuth as login has caused account-takeover bugs."

        options: ["GCM", "CTR", "ECB", "CBC"],
        answer: 2,

        q: "The avalanche effect of a good hash means",
        options: ["the hash is reversible", "collisions are easy to find", "the digest grows with the input", "flipping one input bit flips about half the output bits"],
        answer: 3,
        explain: "A tiny input change produces a completely different digest, with no partial similarity to exploit — which is what makes hashes useful for integrity."
      },
      {
        q: "To get confidentiality and integrity together, you should use",
        options: ["an AEAD mode such as AES-GCM", "ECB mode", "Base64 encoding", "a plain SHA-256 of the data"],
        answer: 0,
        explain: "Authenticated encryption (AEAD) like AES-GCM or ChaCha20-Poly1305 encrypts and produces an authentication tag, so tampering is detected on decryption."

        answer: 1,
        explain: "Encrypt to someone with their public key; only their matching private key can decrypt. You sign as yourself with your private key — don't swap these."

        q: "To produce a digital signature on a document, you use",
        options: ["the recipient's public key", "a shared symmetric secret", "your own private key", "the certificate authority's key"],
        answer: 2,
        explain: "Signing uses your private key (only you have it); anyone can verify with your public key. That asymmetry is what gives non-repudiation."

        options: ["transmit a secret key safely over the wire", "store passwords", "sign messages", "derive a shared secret over a public channel without sending it"],
        answer: 3,
        explain: "Both sides compute the same shared secret from exchanged public values; an eavesdropper who sees everything still faces the infeasible discrete-log problem."

        q: "Forward secrecy (from ephemeral key exchange) guarantees that",
        options: ["past recorded sessions stay safe even if the long-term key leaks later", "handshakes are faster", "certificates can be smaller", "no certificate authority is needed"],
        answer: 0,
        explain: "Ephemeral keys exist only in memory for one session. Stealing the server's long-term key later cannot decrypt previously recorded traffic — defeating 'harvest now, decrypt later'."

        options: ["encrypt all application data for the whole session", "authenticate the server and agree a key, then switch to symmetric AES", "only compress the data", "replace the need for certificates"],
        answer: 1,
        explain: "TLS is hybrid: slow asymmetric crypto authenticates and establishes a shared key, then fast symmetric crypto (e.g. AES-GCM) protects the bulk data."

        q: "A valid TLS certificate proves",
        options: ["the website is safe and trustworthy", "the site has no vulnerabilities", "the server's identity — that you're talking to that domain", "your data is anonymized"],
        answer: 2,
        explain: "The padlock means 'encrypted to whoever this is', not 'trustworthy'. Phishing sites can hold perfectly valid certificates."

        q: "The right way to store user passwords is",
        options: ["a single SHA-256", "reversibly encrypted in the database", "Base64 encoded", "a slow, salted hash such as Argon2id or bcrypt"],
        answer: 3,
        explain: "Use a deliberately slow, memory-hard hash with a unique per-user salt. Fast hashes (even SHA-256) let attackers try billions of guesses per second after a leak."
      },
      {
        q: "Adding a unique salt to each password hash mainly",
        options: ["makes identical passwords hash differently and defeats rainbow tables", "slows the hash down", "encrypts the password", "removes the need to hash"],
        answer: 0,
        explain: "A per-user salt means two users with the same password get different digests, and precomputed rainbow tables are useless. Slowness comes from the algorithm's cost factor."

        answer: 1,
        explain: "Broken Access Control remains #1 in the 2025 list. Authentication being correct says nothing about whether a user may access this specific object, function or data field."

        options: ["blocklisting words like DROP", "manually escaping quotes", "parameterized / prepared statements", "hiding SQL errors from users"],
        answer: 2,

        options: ["limiting input length", "a web application firewall alone", "using HTTPS", "contextual output encoding, backed by a Content-Security-Policy"],
        answer: 3,
        explain: "Encode user data for the output context so it renders as text, not markup, and add CSP to block inline/third-party script. Blocklist filters always lose."

        options: ["Secure", "HttpOnly", "SameSite", "Domain"],
        answer: 1,
        explain: "HttpOnly hides the cookie from document.cookie, so script injected via XSS can't exfiltrate the session token. Secure forces HTTPS; SameSite limits cross-site sending."
