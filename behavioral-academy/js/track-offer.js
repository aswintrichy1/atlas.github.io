      questions: [
        {
          q: "Two offers quote the same four-year total. Offer A vests evenly across four years; offer B is back-loaded, paying most of the grant in years three and four. You think there is a real chance you leave after two years. Which is worth more to you?",
          options: [
            "Offer B, because back-loaded schedules normally come with a larger headline total",
            "Offer B, because unvested equity is normally paid out when you leave",
            "They are identical, because the four-year totals match",
            "Offer A, because more of the grant lands inside the window you will actually be there"
          ],
          answer: 3,
          explain: "Equity is only worth what vests while you are still employed, so the shape matters as much as the total. Under even vesting you have banked about half the grant at 24 months; under a back-loaded schedule you have banked far less, because the large tranches are still ahead of you. Unvested equity is normally forfeited on departure, not paid out, so the headline four-year total quietly assumes you stay all four years."
        },

          q: "Your grant has a one-year cliff and you resign at month eleven. What have you earned from the equity component?",
          options: [
            "Nothing from the grant",
            "About eleven twelfths of the first year's tranche",
            "About a quarter of the grant, prorated across eleven months",
            "The full first-year tranche, paid out at exit"
          ],
          answer: 0,
          explain: "That is the entire point of a cliff: nothing vests at all until the cliff date, so there is no proration to claim. This is why a cliff makes a headline number much riskier than an even schedule for anyone who is unsure about the role. If you are joining a situation you are not confident about, the cliff is a real cost that never appears in the total-compensation figure."
        },
        {
          q: "A recruiter tells you base is already at the top of the band for your level. Which component is most commonly available as an alternative lever?",
          options: [
            "The bonus target percentage, since it is set individually",
            "A one-time sign-on, which sits outside the recurring band",

            "The benefits package, which is usually chosen per candidate"
          ],
          answer: 1,
          explain: "A sign-on is generally the most flexible component precisely because it is one-time: it does not raise your position in the band, so it does not create an internal-equity problem the way an out-of-band base would. Bonus targets and vesting schedules are usually set uniformly by level or by policy, and benefits are almost never individually negotiable. Worth checking whether the sign-on carries a clawback if you leave inside the first year."
        },
        {
          q: "Your loop landed you one level below the one you targeted, and the offer already sits near the top of that lower band. What is usually the higher-value thing to push on?",

            "The very top of the lower band, since you are already close to it",

            "The level itself, using concrete scope evidence from your own work",
            "The bonus target, since it compounds with base"
          ],
          answer: 2,
          explain: "Being near the top of a band means the dollar negotiation has almost no room left in it, while a level change moves you to a different band entirely. A strong position in a lower band is also a weak place to start from: your next raise, bonus target and promotion all get measured against that band's ceiling. A sign-on only papers over year one and leaves the structural problem in place."
        },
        {
          q: "You have no competing offer. Which of these is the most honest description of your position?",

            "You have real but smaller room, built on scope, band data and the cost to them of restarting the search"
          ],
          answer: 3,
          explain: "Leverage-free negotiation genuinely has a lower ceiling, and pretending otherwise leads people to over-push and damage the relationship. What you do still have is real: the scope you are stepping into, whatever you can see of the band, the sunk cost of their search, and the simple fact that asking politely is usually free. Inventing a competing offer is the one move that can lose you the offer outright, because it can be checked and it changes how they read everything else you said."

          ],
          answer: 0,
          explain: "Level is normally decided from the evidence the loop produced, so the leverage is in the loop itself: how much you owned, how much ambiguity you absorbed, how wide the blast radius of your decisions was. By the time the written offer exists, that evidence is already recorded and the recruiter is typically working inside a level someone else set. Asking what evidence would change the level is still worth doing, but it is a much harder conversation than telling the right stories two weeks earlier."

            "The recruiter approves it, since base is the easiest lever they hold",

          ],
          answer: 1,
          explain: "Out-of-band base is usually the single hardest ask in the whole conversation, because it creates a permanent internal-equity problem that outlives your hire. Most recruiters can move freely inside the band and need sign-off above it, so an out-of-band request turns into an exception request with a real chance of a no. If base is the binding constraint, the productive move is to accept the ceiling out loud and redirect to a one-time component."

          ],
          answer: 2,
          explain: "The recruiter is not the decision-maker on exceptions; they are the person who has to retell your case to someone who never met you. A single number with a reason attached survives that retelling intact, while a long list forces them to choose for you and a bare demand gives them nothing to say. Personal need is sympathetic but is not an argument an approver can act on, because it says nothing about the role."

        {
          q: "Early in the process a recruiter asks what number you are looking for. What is the strongest response?",

            "Ask for the band for the level, and say you will engage on numbers once scope and level are settled"
          ],
          answer: 3,
          explain: "Whoever names a number first sets the ceiling of the conversation, and this early you do not yet know the level, so any number you name is a guess against unknown information. Redirecting to the band is not evasion: it answers the real question, which is whether the two of you are in the same universe. Naming a wide range hands them the bottom of it, and naming your current pay anchors your next role to your last one."

          ],
          answer: 0,
          explain: "An extension request reads as stalling unless it comes with a date and a reason, because the fear on their side is that you are shopping the offer indefinitely. A specific date plus a reconfirmation of interest converts the same request into a plan they can hold you to. Silence and open-ended requests both spend goodwill for nothing, and inventing a deadline is a claim that can be checked."

          explain: "The problem is not tone, it is that the sentence cannot be acted on: the recruiter has to guess your number, invent your reason, and then defend both to an approver. Leaving the number to them sounds generous but almost always produces the smallest move they can justify. The upgrade is one number plus one reason \u2014 scope, band position, or a competing figure \u2014 and ideally a sentence that says what closes it."

          answer: 2,
          explain: "That sentence concedes the answer before the other side has said anything, which is the clearest form of negotiating against yourself. Pre-apologising invites the easy no, and it tells the recruiter they do not need to spend any effort advocating for you. The same request without the disclaimer costs you nothing and keeps the burden of saying no where it belongs."

Asking directly what support exists is reasonable and sometimes produces something; waiting quietly reliably produces nothing."
