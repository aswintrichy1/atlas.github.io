          explain: "A single-covered signal is a single point of failure: use it in round one and a later interviewer scoring the same signal gets nothing.

          ],
          answer: 2,
          explain: "Each interviewer writes up the round independently, and the record is then read by a committee or hiring manager who never sat in any of the rooms. Repetition that felt invisible in the moment is obvious in the aggregate, and it reads as a thin bank rather than coincidence.

          answer: 3,
          explain: "The interviewer's form already has the principle written on it; what it lacks is evidence.

Demonstrating the behaviour and letting them file it under whichever principle they like is strictly stronger."

          explain: "A small true story survives probing; a composite does not, because the timeline stops being consistent about two questions in.

A forward-looking hypothetical is a last resort, not an opening move."

          explain: "Answers rarely fail in the first ninety seconds; they fail at minute four, when the prepared material is exhausted and the probes keep coming. Running the same three probes on every story tells you which ones have a second layer and which need a number you never recorded. A memorised script makes exactly this problem worse."
