Because the towers never see each other until the similarity score, every item vector can be computed offline and loaded into a nearest-neighbour index — which is what makes retrieval over millions of items possible.

            "Item content features",
            "Static user attributes captured at signup"
          ],
          answer: 0,
          explain: "What a user has actually clicked, watched or skipped is the most predictive thing you have about what they will do next, which is why history features dominate offline metrics. It is also empty for a brand-new account, so a model leaning on it degrades to noise exactly when first impressions matter. The standard answer is a fallback path built from item, context and profile features."

          q: "You are predicting whether a transaction is fraudulent and add the feature 'number of times this account has been manually reviewed'. Why is that dangerous?",
          options: [
            "Count features must be log-transformed before a tree model can use them",
            "Manual review is triggered by suspicion of fraud, so the feature partly encodes the label and will not exist in that form at decision time",
            "The feature is too sparse to carry usable signal",
            "The feature updates too slowly to be predictive"
          ],
          answer: 1,
          explain: "This is target leakage: the feature is a consequence of the thing you are predicting rather than a cause of it. Offline it looks superb, because reviews cluster on fraudulent accounts. In production the review has not happened yet when you must score the transaction, so the feature is absent or zero and the model collapses. The check is to compare the timestamp of every feature against the timestamp of the decision."

          ],
          answer: 2,
          explain: "Training/serving skew happens when one definition of a feature is written twice — once in a batch job, once in a request-path service — and the two drift apart in windowing, default values, or time zone handling. The model then sees a different distribution live than it learned from, and the offline metric never showed it. A feature store's real product is a single definition with two consistent read paths."

          ],
          answer: 3,
          explain: "A random split breaks two assumptions at once. It puts later events in training and earlier events in test, so the model is scored on predicting a past it has already seen; and it puts the same user on both sides, so memorizing that user counts as generalization. Time-ordered data wants a temporal split, and user-grouped data wants a grouped split — often both."

          ],
          answer: 0,
          explain: "A large train/validation gap is the signature of overfitting: the model has enough capacity to memorize the sample rather than the pattern. The levers that help all shrink the effective hypothesis space or grow the sample — weight decay, dropout, early stopping, a smaller model, more or augmented data. Adding capacity or features widens the gap, and changing the threshold moves the operating point without touching generalization."

          q: "A spam filter on a stream that is 0.1% spam reports ROC-AUC of 0.98, but reviewers say most of what it flags is fine. How are both true?",

            "ROC-AUC must have been computed against the wrong column",

            "ROC-AUC and precision measure the same quantity, so one number is simply wrong"
          ],
          answer: 1,
          explain: "ROC curves plot true-positive rate against false-positive rate, and false-positive rate divides by the total number of negatives. When negatives outnumber positives a thousand to one, ten thousand false positives is a false-positive rate of about one percent — invisible on the ROC curve — while precision, which divides by the number of items you flagged, is destroyed. Precision-recall curves have no such blind spot because neither axis involves the true-negative count."

            "The sample was necessarily too small to detect the effect"
          ],
          answer: 2,
          explain: "Standard A/B analysis assumes one user's assignment does not affect another user's outcome. On a marketplace, in a feed with shared inventory, or anywhere arms compete for the same finite resource, that assumption fails and the measured gap includes what treatment took from control. Cluster, geo or switchback randomization restores the assumption at the cost of statistical power."

            "A model rich enough to rank precisely is far too expensive to run across millions of items inside a request budget"
          ],
          answer: 3,
          explain: "Precision at the top of a list comes from cross features and heavy models, and their per-item cost is orders of magnitude above a dot product. Multiply that by corpus size and you blow the latency budget by a wide margin. The two-stage split exists so the expensive model only ever sees a few hundred items that a cheap high-recall stage has already narrowed down."

            "Set K to match the training batch size"
          ],
          answer: 0,
          explain: "K is a recall-versus-cost dial with a measurable answer. Retrieval recall — the share of items the ranker would have put on the first page that made it into the candidate set — climbs steeply then flattens, and the flattening point is your K. Then you sanity-check it against the budget, because the ranker's cost is linear in K."

          ],
          answer: 1,
          explain: "Precomputation converts an inference problem into a lookup problem, which is unbeatable on latency and cost — but only if you can enumerate the inputs ahead of time and tolerate the staleness between runs. Daily emails and homepage shelves fit. Anything keyed on request-time context, or anything that must react within seconds, does not."

          answer: 2,
          explain: "Batching amortizes fixed per-call overhead across many requests, so throughput per unit of hardware goes up. The price is paid by the individual request, which sits in a queue until the batch is full or a timeout fires. Tune the maximum wait against your tail-latency target: a few milliseconds is often free, tens of milliseconds usually is not."

          q: "Why is monitoring an ML system harder than monitoring an ordinary service?",

          answer: 3,
          explain: "A service tells you it is broken within seconds because a request either succeeded or it did not. A model that has quietly become wrong keeps returning well-formed responses with normal latency, and you only learn the truth when labels arrive — after the chargeback, the appeal, or the churn window. That is why you alert on leading indicators such as feature and score distributions rather than waiting for accuracy to move."

          ],
          answer: 0,
          explain: "Logged clicks tell you nothing about items you never displayed, so each generation of the model can only confirm the previous one's beliefs and the catalogue it draws from narrows. Randomizing a small slice of traffic puts unbiased observations into the log, and recording the probability with which each item was shown lets you reweight the rest. Both must happen at decision time — a propensity cannot be reconstructed afterwards."

    blurb: "The interview round where the hard part is choosing an objective you can measure and defending a modelling choice — not sizing a cache. A six-phase phase plan with time budgets, then the modelling vocabulary you have to defend under pressure: embeddings and approximate retrieval, features and the five ways they betray you, honest data splits, and the metrics that decide whether any of it worked. Closes with the operational half most candidates skip — two-stage serving, inference architecture, drift, and the feedback loop that lets a system quietly poison its own training data.",
