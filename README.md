# The Atlas Collection

Five interactive, **fully-offline** learning atlases behind a single hub. Read a concept, then *poke* it — every idea has an interactive lab, quiz, or visualization. Progress is saved locally in your browser; nothing is ever sent to a server.

| Atlas | Topic | Highlights |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Blueprint** | System & software design | HLD · LLD · reliability · architecture |
| **Codex** | DSA & coding interviews | Data structures · algorithms · problem-solving patterns |
| **Citadel** | Cybersecurity | 8 tracks · crypto · AppSec · defense · threats & forensics · reverse engineering |
| **Cascade** | Data engineering | Storage · modeling · batch · streaming · orchestration · SQL · Spark |
| **TechLead** | Techno managerial interviews | HLD · LLD · Data Engineering · delivery risk · stakeholders · model answers |

Each atlas includes exam mode, flashcards, interactive widgets, light/dark themes, keyboard shortcuts, a command palette, progress export/import, and installable-PWA support — all with **zero external requests**.

## Run locally

A service worker (offline support) needs `http://`, so serve the folder rather than opening the file directly:

```bash
cd atlas
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open <http://localhost:8000/>. (Opening `index.html` via `file://` still works, just without offline caching.)

## QA

The TechLead app includes a no-dependency smoke page at `qa/techno-managerial-static-qa.html`. Serve the repo locally, open that page, and click **Run QA** to validate static assets, app routes, offline wiring, localStorage keys, and stale-route checks.

## Deploy to GitHub Pages

This folder is self-contained and Pages-ready — real files (no symlinks), a `.nojekyll` marker, and only relative paths, so it works whether the repo is served from a subpath (`https://USER.github.io/REPO/`) or a user site (`https://USER.github.io/`).

1. Create a new GitHub repository and push this folder as the repo root:
   ```bash
   git remote add origin https://github.com/USER/REPO.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
2. In the repo: **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source: Deploy from a branch**, then choose **`main`** and **`/ (root)`**, and save.
3. Wait for the Pages build, then visit the URL shown there. The hub loads, and each card opens its atlas.

No build step runs on GitHub — the deployable copies are already in the app folders (`hld-lld-academy/`, `dsa-patterns-academy/`, `cyber-academy/`, `data-eng-academy/`, `techno-managerial-academy/`).

## Updating an app

The five app folders are **built copies**. To change an app, edit its source elsewhere and re-run `./assemble.sh` (it rebuilds each app via its own `build.sh`, strips dev artifacts and symlinks, and refreshes the copies here), then commit. `assemble.sh` only works on the machine that has the source apps; it is not needed to deploy.
