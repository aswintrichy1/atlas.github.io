The other three all involve a decision that is worthless if it arrives late. Streaming a close report buys you a faster wrong number and a harder audit."

          explain: "The cost is the volume being read, so the only structural fix is making most of that volume skippable. More compute buys speed at proportionally more money and stops helping once the scan dominates.
