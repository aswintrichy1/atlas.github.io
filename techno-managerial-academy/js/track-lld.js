Removing a field breaks anyone who reads it, and \u201cnobody appears to use it\u201d is a statement about your logs rather than about your consumers. Changing a type or a meaning is worse still, because the code keeps working and starts being wrong."

Rejecting is the only answer that surfaces the defect while still refusing to double-charge."

Full end-to-end coverage catches integration problems but is slow and flaky enough that teams stop trusting it. Snapshots pin shape rather than behaviour, so they fail on harmless changes and pass on harmful ones."
